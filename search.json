    "text": "Engineering Plant Immune Receptors\nAs mentioned above, in the coevolutionary arms race between crops and their pathogens, humans are pushing crops forward, but never getting ahead of the pathogens. In fact, we can sometimes be years behind them, resulting in devastating losses for the most vulnerable farmers.\nTraditionally, we breed resistance into crops. We do that by first screening cultivars and their wild counterparts for disease resistance, then laboriously breed them into our elite cultivars, striving to introduce just the disease resistance genes without negatively impacting yield (which often happens). These efforts have decade-long timelines.\nUnfortunately, the threat of crop pathogens is increasing as global trade and climate change expand pathogen range where hosts haven’t evolved resistance. Now more than ever, we need better, faster methods to retool crop immune systems to fight of disease.\n\n\nIn Rim, Garrett et. al (2024), we charted one path forward. Focusing on rice blast, a crop disease destroying enough food each year to feed 60 million people, we used directed evolution to evolve plant immune receptors to detect pathogens that had escaped detection. By recapitulating the interaction in a yeast-based system, we could run directed evolution campaigns at unprecedented scale. This also yielded rich datasets used in Howard, Rim, Garrett, et al. (2025) to train the protein language model ESM2 to predict the recognition capacity of new plant immune receptors. When we have a new immune receptor sequence that can recognize pathogens, we can use gene editing tools to mirror the changes in crops.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlant immune receptors displayed on the surface of yeast cells binding to fluorescently-labeled pathogen molecules.\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more, see the preprints linked above."
